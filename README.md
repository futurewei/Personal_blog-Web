# Toy personal web


This is a personal web, implemented using Django. It's intended as as practice to solid my knowledge in Django and prepare myself for the intern program. The web supports functionality like posting and displaying personal blog and some personal introduction. The design is pretty rough now, I will optimize it as time goes.
