# Toy personal web


This is a personal web, implemented using Django. It's intended as as practice to solid my knowledge in Django and prepare myself for the intern program. The web supports functionality like posting and displaying personal blog and some personal introduction. The design is still relatively rough, I will optimize it when I have time.

After writing my blog, the article would be rendered in the blow page
